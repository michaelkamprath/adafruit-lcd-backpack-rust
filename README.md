# Rust driver for Adafruit's I2C LCD Backpack
_NOTE: This library is not made by Adafruit, and is not supported by them. The use of the Adafruit name is for compatibility identification purposes only._

This library is a Rust driver for the [Adafruit I2C LCD Backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/292). It is inspired by Adafruit's Python and C libraries for the same device, though this library only supports the MCP23008 backpack connecting via I2C.

**This library is a work in progress.** It is not yet ready for use. This library is designed to be used with the `embedded-hal` traits, and is tested with the Raspberry Pi Pico using the `rp-pico` crate.
